# DSA C

This repo contains implementations of different data structures in C.

## Build & run

I have created a general Makefile to manage the build process.

Generated executable is located at ```./dsa_c```

``` sh
# Build the object files and executable
make

# Build and run together
make run

# Clean all build files from directory
make clean
```
